## Easily perform Twitch chat sentiment & emotion analysis in real-time

 Moodmonitor is an automated web-based IRC client which can connect to Twitch Chat and
 analyze the current sentiment and dominant emotions. The results of both
 the sentiment & emotion  analysis are visualized through charts on a web-dashboard.
 In a future version the generated data is supposed to be downloadable.

## üîç Sentiment analysis with Afinn
 Moodmonitor uses the Afinn library (Nielsen 2011) to judge the sentiment of
 a message in chat and calculates averages in user defined intervals.
 Since the Afinn library is primarily designed for the English language the script
 can only be used in English speaking twitch communities.


## ü´Ç Emotion analysis
 Emotes play a special role in the communication in Twitch chat.
 However, a sentiment analysis with Afinn is unable to grasp this dimension.
 That is why Moodmonitor uses an innovative approach of analyzing
 dominant emotions. The approach to classification is based on the
 psychological model "The Hourglass of Emotions" (Cambria, Livingstone, Hussain 2011).
 More specifically the second-level emotions (ibid.: 153) have been used
 as categories. The most used emotes of Twitch and the popular browser extensions
 FZZ and BTTV (StreamElements 2021) have been assigned to the category that
 best matches their intended meaning respectively.
 The script counts how often emotes of a certain category have been used and
 reports what percentage of messages expressed the dominant emotion.
 
 This is a simple and effective approach that may cause problems with validity
 not least because coding has been conducted by a single person. A survey that
 tries to identify the float values of "Pleasantness", "Attention", "Sensitivity"
 and "Aptitude" for every emote, which could be used to identify the associated
 second-level emotions more accurately seems like a costlier but superior approach
 (cf. Cambria, Livingstone, Hussain 2011: 151-152).


## üìÇ Explanation of the project structure
 The moodmonitor.py script accesses two files in the "JSON Files" folder.
 One stores the supplied OAuth Token and username. It will be created when you use
 the application for the first time. The other one contains the 
 needed data for the emotion analysis in a JSON File.

## Problems regarding validity
 Since all emotes have been categorized by myself in 2020 there may be problems 
 regarding the validity of the generated emotion reports. The meaning of Twitch
 emotes may be ambiguous, it most likely changes over time and different contexts
 can have different connotations. The popular emote "OMEGALUL" i.e.
 is most commonly used to express gloat when a fail occurs but it could also be used to 
 express genuine approval of a funny joke which would express optimism.
 All of these caveats are not addressed with the current hard coded approach
 to the classification of emotes.
 However, a machine learning algorithm may be capable of addressing
 these problems in the future. Alternatively regular surveys of Twitch users
 could also be a worthwhile approach to solve these problems.
